### Gulp
The most important Gulp concept is streams. Think of your files passing through a pipe; at one or more points along that pipe, an action is taken. For example, we could insert all our JavaScript files into a scripts pipe which:
- concatenates files into one
- removes console and debugger statements
- minifies the code
- puts the resulting file in a specific location

### Bower
 is a package manager that lets you easily download JavaScript libraries, such as bootstrap and jQuery, via a command line instead of visiting each individual website, downloading, extracting and adding it to the project manually.
